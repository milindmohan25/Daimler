# Daimler Project - Telltale Requirements (Redacted for Confidentiality)

> Note: Some identifiers and proprietary logic have been redacted or anonymized to preserve Daimlerâ€™s confidential information. This document is intended for internal use or open-source collaboration with approved teams only.

## Overview

This document outlines the software requirements for telltale (warning/indicator) logic implementation in the Daimler HMI Phase-2 project. Each requirement includes data mapping, communication logic, and display behavior for individual telltales.

## Confidential Handling

* Proprietary identifiers like **CAN ID**, **SPN**, and internal logic for specific telltales have been masked or marked as `CONFIDENTIAL`.
* Full logic and safety algorithms must be stored securely and only shared with authorized contributors.
