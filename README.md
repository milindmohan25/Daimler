Project Scope:
The Daimler HMI Phase-2 project focused on developing and validating Human-Machine Interface (HMI) screens for electric vehicle dashboard systems. The project aimed to ensure clear, responsive, and compliant user interface elements for displaying real-time vehicle status related to charging, driving modes, and system alerts.
 Key Features Developed:
Battery Charging Status Display
Battery Charger ON/OFF indicators
Charger Connection ON alert
Cruise Control (CC) Indicators

CC Active (CC X.X KMPH)

CC OFF / CC Limit OFF

High Voltage System Status

High Voltage ON/OFF display based on vehicle state

Limp Mode Notifications

LIM KMPH ON

LIMPHOME ON/OFF

Vehicle STOP/Default Conditions

Default Normal Mode, Default STOP ON

Message Menu Implementation

Multi-slide message handling system for system or user alerts

ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies Used:
HMI Design Tools: Embedded GUI tools (e.g., Altia, EB Guide, or Qt)

Communication Protocols: CAN (for signal integration with vehicle ECUs)

Validation Tools: CANoe, CANalyzer

Languages: CAPL, Embedded C (for signal simulation and testing)

Platforms: AUTOSAR-based ECU architecture, Vector Tools

ðŸ”§ Responsibilities (sample â€” adjust based on your role):
Developed HMI logic to visualize EV states like charging, high voltage, and limp mode.

Mapped CAN signals to HMI elements based on Daimler's specifications.

Performed integration testing to ensure real-time signal updates and smooth screen transitions.

Created test cases for all 15 screen slides and validated output on HIL benches.

Collaborated with UI/UX and diagnostics teams for signal mapping and visual consistency.

ðŸš€ Project Impact:
Enabled Daimlerâ€™s next-generation electric vehicles to provide intuitive, safety-compliant, and real-time visual feedback to drivers. This significantly improved user experience and vehicle diagnostics transparency
